  "abstract": "“Fin” is the end and “novo” is a new beginning, a photofilm about a cemetery café in Berlin. A café is a place for chatting. A cemetery is a place for introspection. The “cemetery-café” Finovo is a place where both is possible. Bernd, Dirk and Günther visit the graves of their life partners regularly – and then stop by the café to share their memories and experiences.",
