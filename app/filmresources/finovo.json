  "abstract": "A café is a place for chatting, a cemetery is a place for introspection. The “cemetery-café” Finovo—“Fin” is the end and “novo” is a new beginning—is a place where both is possible. Bernd, Dirk and Günther visit the graves of their life partners regularly—and stop by the café to share their memories and experiences.",
