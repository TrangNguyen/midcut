Trang Nguyen's filmmaker portfolio
----------------------------------

# AngularJS, RequireJS, angular-isotope, angular-translate.

Using ngResource, reading json files which are divided for each film (and perhaps language).

# CTA
* it should be clearly labeled that the navigation buttons filter the work or go to a page.
* See this one for styling our [navigation menu with hover color changes using CSS](http://alistapart.com/article/taminglists/)
* Has smooth scrolling when video is shown.

# TODOs
* Add contact and about page to the footer navigation
* Fix the browser history with back button. Because of the url rewrite without reload(?)
* Add favicon
